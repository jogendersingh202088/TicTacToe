How to Play :

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on an empty square.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
